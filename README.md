  Context:
  A global E-commerce website named Topkart uses an API to handle lightning deals. Lightning deals are products that are available at a discounted price on the website for a brief   amount of time. The expiry time of a lightning deal is not more than 12 hours. These will be refreshed at 00:00 UTC daily. The functionality of Topkart API:  

  Admin actions  
  Create and update lightning deals  
  Approve orders

  Check the status of their order
